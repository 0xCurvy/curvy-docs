# How You Stay in Control

Curvy is a self-custody wallet, which means only you can access your funds, not Curvy, not a third party. This gives you true ownership, but it also means you’re responsible for your security.

Here’s how Curvy keeps you in control, and how you can keep your assets safe.

## You Own the Keys - Always

When you create your Curvy wallet:

- Your private keys are generated locally in your browser  
- They are never stored, uploaded, or sent to Curvy servers  
- You stay in full control, at all times

::: info
Even if Curvy goes offline, your wallet still works. You can export your keys and restore access anytime, as long as you’ve backed them up securely.

## Your Password Protects Local Access

After wallet creation, you’ll set a password to protect your Curvy account on your current device.

- This password encrypts your wallet locally  
- Without it, even someone with access to your browser and device can’t use your wallet  

::: warning 
Curvy does not store or back up your password.  
If you lose it and don’t have your recovery phrase, your wallet and funds are unrecoverable.

### We Never Store Your Private Keys

Once you create your wallet, you will have the option to back up your private keys.  
This is the only way to recover your wallet if you ever lose access on your current device.

You should:

- Write them down and store them somewhere safe (preferably offline)  
- Never share them with anyone, not even Curvy  
- Never enter them into unknown websites, pop-ups, or DMs

**Important:** If someone gets access to your private keys, they can control your funds.  
If you lose them, you lose access to your wallet — permanently.

### No Centralised Recovery, Ever

Curvy doesn’t use custodians, guardians, recovery emails, or third-party providers.

That’s the point:

- No backdoors  
- No hidden admins  
- No company that can “reset” your account

It’s just you and your keys, pure self-sovereignty.

### You Choose How to Use Your Stealth Addresses

With Curvy, you have full control over how your funds are managed — including which stealth addresses you use when sending crypto.

When making a transfer:

- You choose which stealth address to send from  
- You decide where the funds go: another stealth address, a regular wallet (EOA), or even directly into a dApp.

Curvy gives you the privacy tools, but doesn’t force specific flows.  
We provide best-practice guidelines to help you maximize your privacy, but at the end of the day, you’re in charge, and you decide how you use your wallet.

### Takeaways

- **You own your wallet:** Curvy never holds your funds or your keys  
- **You’re responsible for your recovery:** so back up your private keys securely  
- **You control your privacy:** Curvy won’t expose your info, but how you use it matters  
- **You decide how to send funds:** When making transfers, you choose which stealth address to send from. We provide best practice guidelines for maximum privacy, but the choice is always yours.
