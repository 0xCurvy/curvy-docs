There are 2 ways to receive crypto into Curvy:

### Option 1: Share Your Curvy ID

- Share your Curvy ID with the sender (e.g. `yourname.curvy.name` )
- Anyone using a wallet that supports ENS off-chain resolvers can send funds to your Curvy ID privately.
When someone enters your Curvy ID in the recipient field, Curvy automatically generates a new stealth address in the background.
This allows you to receive private, unlinkable transactions through a familiar and shareable format supported across a wide range of ENS-compatible wallets. Every incoming payment goes to a new stealth address, keeping your transfers unlinkable and your identity protected.

### Option 2: Manually Generate a Stealth Address

- Tap `Receive` in the Curvy app

**Note:**  
- Curvy supports Ethereum and Starknet. Make sure to select the correct network before sharing your newly generated stealth address, Ethereum and Starknet addresses are different.  
- Unlike other wallets, Curvy addresses are designed for one-time use. That’s what makes them stealth addresses. Reusing an address reduces your privacy.
