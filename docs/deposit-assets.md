There are 2 ways to receive crypto into Curvy:

### Option 1: Share Your Curvy ID

- Share your Curvy ID with the sender (e.g. `yourname.curvy.box` )
- Every time someone pastes your Curvy ID into a wallet that supports ENS, a new stealth address is generated.

This ensures every incoming payment goes to a different address, keeping all your transfers unlinkable.

### Option 2: Manually Generate a Stealth Address

- Tap `Receive` in the Curvy app
- You’ll see a new stealth address generated automatically
- You can also refresh or tap the refresh icon to get a new one

**Note:**  
- Curvy supports Ethereum and Starknet. Make sure to select the correct network before sharing your newly generated stealth address, Ethereum and Starknet addresses are different.  
- Unlike other wallets, Curvy addresses are designed for one-time use. That’s what makes them stealth addresses. Reusing an address reduces your privacy.
