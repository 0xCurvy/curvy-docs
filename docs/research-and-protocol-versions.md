# Research & Protocol Versions

Curvy is based on real cryptographic research. The ideas behind how it works come from academic papers that help us build a system that’s not only private, but also reliable, secure, and ready for the future.

All of these papers were created by the Curvy team, in collaboration with our colleagues at [3327](https://3327.io/).
