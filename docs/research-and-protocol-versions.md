# Research & Protocol Versions

Curvy is based on real cryptographic research. The ideas behind the protocol come from academic papers that help us create a system that’s not only private, but also reliable, secure, and adaptable to evolving security requirements.

These papers were created by the Curvy team in collaboration with our colleagues at [3327](https://3327.io/).
