## 3. Send Assets Privately

To send funds privately:

- Tap “Send”
- Enter the recipient’s Curvy ID or a regular wallet address
- Choose the stealth address you want to send from
- Select token and amount
- Click “Confirm & Send”

Currently, Curvy supports 1:1 private transfers only, which is why you choose the stealth address to send from.  
However, we are working on enabling private batch transactions, where Curvy will automatically combine assets from multiple stealth addresses and handle everything under the hood, while still preserving full privacy.
