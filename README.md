# Curvy Docs

This repository contains the official documentation for [Curvy](https://www.0xcurvy.io/), a stealth address protocol for private, secure, and compliant crypto transactions across the Ethereum and Starknet ecosystems.

Curvy lets users send and receive funds and interact with dApps without exposing their identity, balances, or on-chain activity, while staying compliant when needed.
